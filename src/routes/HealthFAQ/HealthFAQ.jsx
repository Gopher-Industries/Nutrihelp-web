        id: "water-intake",
        question: "How much water should I drink daily?",
        answer: "The general recommendation is about 2 liters or 8 glasses of water per day. However, individual needs may vary depending on factors like age, gender, weather, and physical activity. A good indicator is the color of your urine - it should be light yellow."

        id: "calorie-intake",
        question: "How many calories do I need per day?",

      },
      {
        id: "meals-per-day",
        question: "How many meals should I eat per day?",
        answer: "There's no one-size-fits-all answer, but most nutrition experts recommend 3 main meals with 1-2 healthy snacks. The key is to listen to your body's hunger and fullness cues rather than strictly adhering to a specific number of meals."
      },
      {
        id: "healthy-weight",
        question: "What's a healthy way to maintain weight?",
        answer: "A balanced diet rich in whole foods, regular physical activity (at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise weekly), adequate sleep, and stress management are key components of healthy weight maintenance. Focus on lifestyle changes rather than short-term diets."

        id: "sleep-importance",
        question: "How does sleep affect nutrition and health?",

        id: "alcohol-guidelines",
        question: "What are the recommended alcohol limits?",

        id: "omega3-benefits",
        question: "Why are omega-3 fatty acids important?",
        answer: "Omega-3s support brain function, reduce inflammation, and promote heart health. The body can't produce them, so they must come from diet. Best sources include fatty fish (salmon, mackerel), flaxseeds, chia seeds, walnuts, and algae-based supplements."
