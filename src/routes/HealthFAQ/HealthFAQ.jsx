                answer: "The general recommendation is about 2 liters or 8 glasses of water per day. However, individual needs may vary depending on factors like age, gender, weather, and physical activity. A good indicator is the color of your urine - it should be light yellow."

                answer: "There's no one-size-fits-all answer, but most nutrition experts recommend 3 main meals with 1-2 healthy snacks. The key is to listen to your body's hunger and fullness cues rather than strictly adhering to a specific number of meals."

                question: "How does sleep affect nutrition and health?",
                answer: "Quality sleep regulates hormones that control appetite (ghrelin and leptin), supports metabolism, and aids recovery. Chronic sleep deprivation increases cravings for high-calorie foods and is linked to weight gain and metabolic disorders."

Many countries have banned artificial trans fats, but they may still appear as 'partially hydrogenated oils' on labels."
